# Judicious

![Judicious](judicious.png)

**Judicious** is a pedagogical documentation system for Python.
It offers a clear and distinctive visual representation of functions and constants;
gradually presents more information such as types, optional and variable-length parameters for functions;
highlights functions with side effects;
and instantaneously generates documentation also for functions defined in student code.
